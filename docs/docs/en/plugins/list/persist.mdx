# Persist Plugin

The `persistPlugin` is used to persist the state of a store in `localStorage`. It ensures that the state of your store is maintained across page reloads by saving and rehydrating the state from storage.

## Import

```mdx
import { persistPlugin } from '@vegajs/vortex/plugins';
```

## Usage

The `persistPlugin` takes an options object with the following properties:

- `key` (string, `required`): The key used to store the state in `localStorage`.
- `properties` (array of keys, optional): A list of specific properties to persist. If not provided, all reactive properties will be persisted.

```mdx
type PersistOptions<T> = {
  key: string;
  properties?: Array<NonFunctionKeys<T>>;
};
```

---

#### Base

```mdx
const counterStore = defineStore(
  ({ reactive, computed }) => {
    const count = reactive(0);
    const doubleCount = computed(() => count.get() * 2);

    return { count, doubleCount };
  },
  { plugins: [persistPlugin({ key: 'counterStore' })] },
);
```

#### With properties

```mdx
const counterStore = defineStore(
  ({ reactive, computed }) => {
    const count = reactive(0); // only count will be saved
    const doubleCount = computed(() => count.get() * 2);

    return { count, doubleCount };
  },
  { plugins: [persistPlugin({ key: 'counterStore', properties: ['count'] })] },
);
```

## Plugin Details

The `persistPlugin` works by saving the store state to `localStorage` and rehydrating it on initialization. This allows the store to maintain its state between page reloads.

> [!WARNING]
> If an error occurs while parsing the saved state, the plugin will remove the corrupted item from `localStorage` to prevent issues.

## Notes

- The plugin uses `localStorage` to persist state, making it suitable for browser environments.
- The plugin supports both `reactive` and `query-based` states, ensuring they are properly rehydrated.
